Recently we caught up with Director Louise Edwards, who told us why Europeana Cloud is so valuable for The European Library, for researchers and for the cultural heritage community as a whole.</em></p>\n<p>\n    <strong>What is The European Library and what role does it play within the Europeana Cloud project?</strong></p>\n<p>\n    <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\">The European Library</a> takes in metadata from Europe’s libraries and forwards it to Europeana. We have multiple roles within the Europeana Cloud project. We are the project coordinator, responsible for making sure that all partners pull together strategically and that the project works as a whole.</p>\n<p>\n    We are also one of the three main aggregators of the project, along with the <a href=\"http://fbc.pionier.net.pl/owoc\">Polish Digital Libraries Federation</a>, a national aggregator in Poland, and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a>, thesuper-aggregator for all of Europe’s cultural metadata. Together we’re working to develop a shared infrastructure that all three of us can use. Once the project is finished, this infrastructure will be broadened and opened up to other aggregators.</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>How will this new infrastructure change the way that The European Library works?</strong></p>\n<p>\n    At the moment each aggregator is running different hardware and software, and our data sits in different places. We can’t share data without going through a time-consuming process of importing and exporting data. It can take time to change formats, it can take time to pass the data from A to B.</p>\n<p>\n    With the Cloud, we’ll have a shared infrastructure where it’s much easier to get hold of the data, to share it and to use it in different ways. Imagine a shared network drive within an office, which allows you to access anyone else’s data within the office and to take that data and use or share it for any purpose. At a very simple level, that’s what we’re doing within Europeana Cloud– although there will be greater controls on how different users can use the data</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>What value will this new shared infrastructure have for The European Library?</strong></p>\n<p>\n    For a start, the Cloud should help to reduce our costs. We currently spend a lot of time forwarding data to Europeana, sending it from our system to their system. There’s a real friction cost involved in passing this data around. If we are running the same system, less time will be taken to speak technically to Europeana. It will be much easier for them to access and harvest our data.</p>\n<p>\n    It will also allow The European Library to better enrich that data, transform it and allow other people to build tools on top of that data so it becomes much more open. As an example, one of the things we’re really interested in is a tool for entity extraction. That’s where you have computers recognise names and locations within data. If someone were to build this tool within the Cloud, we could use it to enrich all or some of the data and then feed the data back into our own portal or share it in other ways to benefit users.</p>\n<p>\n    The key here is that the Cloud will give us a two-way process of updating and enriching content and then creating subsets that are useful for different types of end user groups.</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Why is it important to divide data up into different categories or subsets in the first place?</strong></p>\n<p>\n    Europeana provides access to 30 million records which you can search. That volume of data is wonderful but it also makes it difficult to find material related to precise topics or to locate types of data such as sounds. What the Cloud will allow people to do is to pre-select various parts of the data and to build tools on top of those separate indexes of data.</p>\n<p>\n    Let me give you an example. Imagine a researcher who discovers a collection of letters from a famous politician. Under the current system, the researcher can’t download the data and the only tools he can use to analyse the collection are the ones provided by the aggregator (in this case Europeana). Europeana Cloud offers a platform, to get access to the letters and to build a tool to transcribe the letters. He could then return the transcriptions to the Cloud so that so that everyone can have access to that new and enhanced data. By everyone, we mean not only other researchers but also the original institution that provided the data.</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Are there similar Cloud projects to this one at the moment or is it unique?</strong></p>\n<p>\n    This is quite unique in terms of cultural heritage. There are similar projects in different fields. <a href=\"http://www.eudat.eu/\">EUDAT</a>, for example, is building a distributed structure for sharing scientific research data related to subject areas such as Climate Modeling and Human Physiology. They need much more complex controls related to authorisation and authentication because there are data protection issues but the concept of sharing data over a common infrastructure with different groups is essentially the same as Europeana Cloud.</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>When will people be able to access the Cloud?</strong></p>\n<p>\n    The first experience many people will have of the cloud is through the prototype tools we are building for specific communities. We already have <a href=\"http://greenlearningnetwork.com/axiom/\">a tool for early modern philosophy</a> and this year we’re using data in Europeana to build a specific tool for people working in musicology.</p>\n<p>\n    By the end of the project, we’ll have APIs or data dumps that will allow people to access the data in the cloud, take away what they’re interested in and build tools using the data.</p>\n<p>\n    Through all of these ways, we’re showing how Europeana Cloud can be valuable in segmenting data for specific communities, rather than putting the focus on millions of pieces of data which nobody can really search through effectively.</p>\n<p>\n    <em>To learn more about Europeana Cloud, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeana_cloud\">follow us on Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/newsletter\">subscribe to our newsletter</a>.</em></p>', '{\"file\":\"https:\\/\\/farm3.staticflickr.com\\/2915\\/14034772030_01f6fac60f.jpg\"}', ''),

In order to do this, the project has undertaken research to find out what tools these researchers already use, what they would like to use, how Europeana can help them today and what changes need to be made to better help them in the future.</p>\n<p>\n    Several Expert Forums have taken place in order to gather this information, with humanities researchers from seven countries giving their feedback and generating ideas.</p>\n<p>\n    So what did our researchers say?</p>\n<p>\n    First of all, they told us about the tools they already use for research and collaboration, which include mainstream services such as: Google (including cloud services like Google Drive); social media like Facebook, LinkedIn and Pinterest; Microsoft Office products and open source alternatives; specialised research tools such as Open Refine (formerly, Google Refine), R as an interface to query and analyse text corpora statistically, tools for authorship attribution, GIS applications (or QGIS, an open source alternative) and annotation tools. There were also a range of tools tailored to specific topic areas. for some subjects within biblical studies, a geographic visualization tool, ‘eResearch’; for oral history (interviews, audiovisual), a bilingual platform for voice and speech recognition, with full transcription and OCR functionalities, materials will be exported to XML and saved in a data archive in the Netherlands; in musicology, a self-built tool to help with OMR processes (Optical Music Recognition) applied to 16th-century music manuscripts and early printed music.</p>\n<p>\n    Six specialisms within the humanities field were identified as areas in which Europeana content could potentially aid researchers: archaeology, history, law, linguistics, musicology and philosophy. During the Expert Forums, researchers played the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/blog/-/blogs/1977648\">Europeana Treasure Hunt</a> to familiarise themselves with the Europeana portal, in order to be able to provide feedback on how they think it could help them both now and in the future.</p>\n<p>\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/312f7c07-1db3-4ad9-8fd6-10096bf155ce\"></p>\n<p>\n    Example of an item of interest to humanities researchers. \'<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200103/ark__12148_btv1b8443886c.html\">Tableau et carte psycho philosophique de l\'Europe en 1906 / Conçue... par Metz-Masson</a>\', French National Library, public domain</p>\n<p>\n    Having had a chance to check out Europeana, the general consensus was that while all agreed that Europeana is a great instrument for showing the diversity of Europeana culture, at present, it can only serve as a generic discovery service for developing an impression of \'what is out there\' and that content from Europeana would need to be exported out of the portal and into the systems used by researchers where it could be analysed and manipulated.</p>\n<p>\n    To make Europeana into a research tool, the group made the following key recommendations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n        adding and logging user comments, accommodating user-enhanced metadata;</li>\n    <li>\n        boosting import and export possibilities;</li>\n    <li>\n        enhancing search functionality and filtering functionality;</li>\n    <li>\n        moving from exploration and discovery to in-depth descriptions and interconnectedness;</li>\n    <li>\n        stepping up development for interaction and connection with users / user groups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    So what happens next?</p>\n<p>\n    The feedback from Expert Forums such as this one will provide important information for the further development of the project Work Package that is looking at exploiting Europeana Cloud with services and tools for researchers.

Whereas Europeana Cloud is focusing on an infrastructure for aggregators, LoCloud aims to provide a cloud-based service for aggregating and storing data.</p>\n<p>\n    However, LoCloud has a very distinct focus on providing a tailored service for small and medium-sized cultural institutions.

One part of this project is to develop Europeana Labs as a forum for experimentation with Europeana’s data for the creative industries (e.g., publishing, tourism).</p>\n<p>\n    There are obvious connections with Europeana Cloud here – how will Labs exploit the data uploaded to Europeana Cloud? What kind of data will be available? What creative and experimental uses of that data would be possible? And under what licensing conditions? Indeed, a Revised Europeana Licensing Framework is a common goal of the two projects.</p>\n<p>\n    The Cloud Coordination Group also invites other members with overlapping interests. The <a href=\"http://www.tagcloudproject.eu/\">TagCloud </a>project aims to enhance experience of cultural heritage by sharing users’ preferences via a cloud-based infrastructure.

In the meantime, we\'ve selected four questions from the workshop to answer here, in this blog post. </p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Q1. Who is Europeana Cloud for? </strong><br>\n    The first versions of Europeana Cloud will be for the three aggregators in the project: The European Library, the Polish Digital Library Federation and Europeana itself. Europeana Cloud aims to be a data storage platform that replaces their current systems. As Europeana Cloud develops, we will open membership to aggregators and cultural heritage organisations (likely in early 2016). They will be able to use the cloud to upload and share metadata and content among members. Finally, data will also be made available to end users via APIs and third-party tools, according to access conditions stipulated by the data provider.<br><br><strong>Q2. Will the Europeana Cloud service be free? </strong><br>\n    The business model underpinning the service is still being developed. We\'ll aim to make many features and services available for free or at a minimal cost, however it\'s unlikely that we\'ll be able to offer free storage for content providers. Our goal is to develop a system that offers clear value-for-money over existing options.</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Q3. What types of metadata will be accepted and under what license? </strong><br>\n    That needs to be decided through consultation with project partners, potential content providers and the researchers who we hope will use the content. We naturally would like as much of the content as possible to be available under a CC0, to enable re-use by the research community. Equally, we are aware that some types of metadata (eg. rich geotagged metadata) may require difference licenses and will be exploring the issues around that.<br><br><strong>Q4. Will Europeana Cloud make its documentation and standards Open Source?</strong><br>\n    Yes! We will adhere to the spirit of all Europeana projects and make as much of our work Open Source as possible. You can already read the reports prepared in the first year of the project <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/results/-/document_library_display/p6BV/view/1915215\">here on our website</a>, including the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/1414567/1915215/D2.2+Initial+Version+of+Architecture+Design+Document\">initial proposed architecture</a> and the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/1414567/1915215/D4.1+Initial+Metadata+Ingestion+Plan\">first sets of metadata</a> that will be added to the cloud.</p>\n<p>\n    If you’d like to learn more about the project, and want to be notified as it opens to new partners, please <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/newsletter\">sign up for our newsletter.</a> You are also welcome to contact project coordinator Alastair Dunning (alastair.dunning@kb.nl) with questions. </p>', '{\"file\":\"http:\\/\\/farm3.staticflickr.com\\/2824\\/11203799506_5c2f764a6f_z.jpg\"}', ''),

The game took no more than 30 minutes including playing and feedback time. In order to see current features, all teams started by creating a My Europeana profile.</p>\n<p>\n    The game contained questions on using multiple search terms for the same event, such as the First World War. We found that different terms brought up different results - something for us to discuss later on in the day.</p>\n<p>\n    We knew that the disparity in metadata fields was an issue, so the second question offered players one point for every item they found in Europeana with 11 or more completed metadata fields.</p>\n<p>\n    Finally, working on the same principle as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlewhack\">Googlewhacks</a>, teams were asked to use the search function to try to find the most specific items they could, with the highest scores going to search terms of 2-5 words that could produce just one item. A search term that provided only one result was therefore deemed a Europeanawhack!</p>\n<p>\n    The game received much positive feedback from the participants.</p>\n<h2>\n    Europeana Treasure Hunt 2.0</h2>\n<p>\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/a8a20f98-9401-470a-946f-3b3407965877\"></p>\n<p>\n    Amsterdam Expert Forum, photo by Agiati Benardou</p>\n<p>\n    Following the success of the game in Dublin - it was called for again in the second Expert Forum in Gothenberg (UGOT) in October 2013. This meeting had a slightly different remit to the first - identifying the content and tools that could be used in Europeana. So UGOT took the basic principles of the game and modified the questions so it focused on content types.</p>\n<p>\n    This version was also used in the Expert Forum in Amsterdam, again providing the same space for discussion among the players.</p>\n<h2>\n    Europeana Treasure Hunt 3.0?</h2>\n<p>\n    So where do we go from here?

Despite the fact that user information behaviour literature, aiming to grasp the impact of the digital age in research, is a growing field, scholarly content use is only studied in the context of more general topics. The shift in digital tools to web-based technologies only adds to these complexities.

Today, we are describing the discussions that took place during two consecutive workshops, hosted by the University of Edinburgh, that focused on establishing the legal and economic requirements of Europeana Cloud. The anticipated outcome of the workshops was to gain a better understanding of stakeholders\' expectations and requirements, and as any discussion around Europeana Cloud proves, there was a lot to talk about!</p>\n\n\n<p>\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/6867e34f-4f36-49a9-9f24-3e00886fae6e\"></p>\n<p>\n    <br><em>\'<a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/09428/suub_hist_index_jsp_id_V_2_a_235_1117.html\">Edinburgh</a>\', Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Bremen</em><em> and EuropeanaLocal Deutschland, public domain.</em></p>\n\n<p>\n    Day 1: Key questions regarding the legal principles</p>\n<p>\n    Let’s start with the Legal Principles: we all understand that Europeana Cloud will need a set of rules, agreements and possibly a legal framework to manage and guide the interactions between stakeholders and the exchange of metadata, tools and services, but we don’t know exactly what is required. This is the main question we wanted the workshop participants to address - but finding the way to proceed is not as simple as asking the questions, collecting the answers and writing a set of agreements.</p>\n<p>\n    <br>\n    However, asking this key question is a good place to start, so we asked participants to identify the legal issues they anticipated Europeana Cloud would address. This raised questions such as who would be legally responsible for Europeana Cloud and how access to the metadata, tools and services would be managed.</p>\n<p>\n    <br>\n    How open should Europeana Cloud be?</p>\n<p>\n    In order to give the participants as much information as possible to refine their issues, we introduced two additional perspectives: Pavel Kats from Europeana, responsible for the development of the technical infrastructure <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/blog/-/blogs/europeana-cloud-shared-infrastructure-for-european-cultural-content.%20%20\">described the current design</a> and how it would<a href=\"http://prezi.com/lkrzlnfduvpy/europeana-cloud/\"> enable relationships between stakeholders.</a> Following this, Paul Keller from Kennisland, described the ongoing developments to the Europeana Licensing Framework, the introduction of the Content Re-Use Framework and the<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/e-commerce/directive/index_en.htm\"> legislative requirements </a>that will need to be considered. </p>\n<p>\n    <br>\n    These presentations activated a lively and elaborate debate about legal requirements and issues. One particular recurring point of debate was used as the basis of an exercise to describe the ideal scenarios which addressed how open should Europeana Cloud be, who should have access to the metadata, and who can use it and on what terms. Interestingly, these scenarios yielded very different results from the workshop participants with one clear point of common ground: all groups were in favour of Europeana Cloud enabling open access; the consensus was that compromises would need to be made.</p>\n<p>\n    <br>\n    These points of view, as well as a number of unanswered questions that were raised throughout the day were taken forward into the next workshops, which took a closer look at the economic benefits of participating in Europeana Cloud. </p>\n\n<p>\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/a3232b3b-2fe8-4811-8cfb-4f2dbe574507\"></p>\n<p>\n    <br>\n    Day 2: The benefits of the future business model of Europeana Cloud</p>\n<p>\n    Led by our resident expert on business models, Harry Verwayen, the second day\'s workshop was all about identifying the opportunities Europeana Cloud represents. We introduced illustrator <a href=\"http://www.jamvisualthinking.com/people/12\">Herman Weeda</a> into the day\'s proceedings, who helped us visualise the complex discussions by sketching the future cloud, its processes and issues. We also heard about the perspective of the Danish Museums from Merete Sanderhoff, Statens Museum, who are working towards a more open oriented business model. </p>\n<p>\n    <br>\n    The workshop took us through a series of discussions based on the four key benefit-based stakeholders priorities: lowering costs, increasing effectiveness, delivering efficiencies and improving dissemination. For example, one benefit was defined as ‘increasing find- and usability’ of metadata and content. The opportunity would be to create an easy to use and practical API for Europeana Cloud benefiting researchers, other end-users, and data providers as it would allow their metadata and content to be used more often. </p>\n<p>\n    <br>\n    Forming of the Strategic Task Force</p>\n<p>\n    As we navigated through the ranges of benefits we perceived, we also challenged participants to identify what they didn’t know about Europeana Cloud and its offerings. Looking at Herman\'s penultimate illustration of the mechanisms involved in delivering the tools and services of Europeana Cloud enabled a fuller debate of where the blurry parts of his picture were. </p>\n\n<p>\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/44db18e4-3ca2-4b39-bf6f-559ee0be9dad\"></p>\n<p>\n    <br>\n    And so the first issues for the Europeana Cloud Strategic Task Force were formed. Composed of active and engaged members of the workshops, the Task Force is challenged to provide best case scenarios that help shape issues related to metadata and content, storage, access, value proposition and sustainability. This Task Force will run over the coming months, developing scenarios and contributing to the refinement of the set of requirements that result from this series of workshops. </p>\n<p>\n    <br>\n    The end result will be a defined, debated and refined set of requirements presented to the Europeana Cloud Plenary in February 2014. These requirements form the foundation of the governance and legal frameworks that will be developed as well as the business models designed to deliver the efficiencies and the sustainability promised by Europeana Cloud.</p>\n<p>\n    <br><br></p>', '{\"file\":\"http:\\/\\/pro.europeana.eu\\/documents\\/89999\\/6867e34f-4f36-49a9-9f24-3e00886fae6e\"}', ''),

Photograph by Norman Rodger.</em>\n\n     \n\n    The meeting was attended by  group of Europeana Cloud partners and researchers from across Europe. The participants\' research interests ranged from gender studies, to economics, to information interaction. Together they discussed and interacted with the Europeana portal and scoped tools for Europeana Cloud.\n\n     \n\n    The forum kicked off with what is fast becoming a staple feature of our expert forums, the Europeana treasure hunt. Designed as a quick way of familiarising participants with Europeana and as an ice-breaker, the reluctance of participants to cease in their treasure hunt efforts showed that social scientists are no less competitive than their humanities counter parts.\n\n     \n\n    With this basic introduction to Europeana and its content complete, the forum changed focus to explore what tools are used by social scientists and what tools they might use to exploit Europeana content. The experts listed a vast array of tools for both quantitative and qualitative research. They also listed a large number of tools for collaboration.\n\n     \n\n    The experts felt they primarily needed visualisation, analysis, and mining tools to exploit Europeana content. All of the experts felt that tools for evaluation of the content was of high importance.\n\n     \n\n    The discussion of tools to evaluate content led nicely into the second breakout session of the expert forum, which took place the following morning and focused on content. This was a slightly more difficult discussion. The experts felt that Europeana did not necessarily need more content but rather more quality content and mechanisms which could be used to evaluate the content coverage and gaps, depth, quality, origin and relevance.\n\n     \n\n    One interesting suggestion was that Europeana should start promoting content to the researcher by formulating research questions that could be explored through the Europeana corpus and encouraging researchers to conduct this research.\n\n     \n\n    Overall, the key message from the expert forum was that Europeana Cloud does not need to answer all research questions or have comprehensive coverage to be useful to the social scientist. It does, however, need to be transparent about the coverage that it does have and engender trust in the content by enabling the user to evaluate it.', '{\"file\":\"http:\\/\\/farm8.staticflickr.com\\/7421\\/10591332324_53c18e8e86_z.jpg\"}', ''),

The goal of the day was to find out the stakeholders\' requirements for the cloud, in order to ensure that Europeana Cloud is built to suit the cultural sector.</p>\n<p>\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/ecec9aed-fdc5-47db-b9cc-50c524c2c88a\"></p>\n<p>\n    \'<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/collectie_SK_C_5.html\">Nachtwacht</a>\' by Rembrandt, Rijksmuseum, public domain</p>\n<p>\n    The day started with a brief tour of the newly reopened Rijksmuseum. Interesting little fact: Did you know that the famous Night Watch by Rembrandt has its own escape hatch? It was built in the 1930s to use in case of emergency. The painting slips down through the hatch into a cycle path that cuts under and through the Rijksmuseum!</p>\n<p>\n    After this great ice-breaker, we went to work exploring the many different types of social principles that should govern Europeana Cloud in a day-long creative brainstorm. These principles are a more concrete implementation of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/blog/-/blogs/europeana-cloud%3A-establishing-the-high-level-principles\">Europeana Cloud High Level Principles</a>.</p>\n<p>\n    The principles that were discussed were wide and varied: enlarging the research community that uses heritage data and content; increasing the number of citations of cultural works; tailoring access to parts of collections according to defined user groups; having higher quality content and metadata (through sharing and enrichment possibilities); having more content to make it more cost-efficient for data providers; having cheap storage; and having metrics to see how data/content is being used.</p>\n<p>\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/6170b636-a80b-4ffa-8498-5edc50a7ab6a\"></p>\n<p>\n    Photograph of the workshop, by Julia Fallon.</p>\n<p>\n    However, one key principle that kept cropping up was the idea that Europeana Cloud needs to be governed by its stakeholders. This notion of a shared ownership of Europeana Cloud is in line with the Europeana <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/cultural-commons\">Cultural Commons principles</a>. It means that each data provider not only owns and controls their own data on the cloud, but they also participate in determining how other users interact with the tools and services available through Europeana Cloud.</p>\n<p>\n    It was agreed that these tools and services should enable efficient online storage and the sharing of cultural heritage content with users, including other institutions and researchers. This should be enabled through a suite of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allows different groups of users to create new tools and services on top of the data stored in Europeana Cloud.</p>\n<p>\n    Operating under a coherent governance model, and a robust technical infrastructure, Europeana Cloud should deliver easier ways of publishing datasets to a sharing platform, one which also shows the authority and integrity of its providers.</p>\n<p>\n    With a lot of requirements identified and debated, we moved on to mapping the key requirements against the level of impact they would have. The results from this were used as the basis for the following two workshops addressing the legal and economic principles, which will be further summarised within WP5 Deliverable D5.1 which translates the output of the workshops into the \'minimum requirements for Europeana Cloud\'.

Cloud computing, or \'the cloud\', for simplicity, have become buzzwords in everyday talk - every kid on the block knows that there are things out there \'in the cloud\' and they are supposed to be safer, cheaper and ever accessible with just an internet connection.</p>\n<p>\n    To bring the European cultural heritage sector and these recent technological innovations together, the European Commission has sponsored the Europeana Cloud project. Its main goal is to take advantage of recent advances in cloud computing technology and to create a cloud-based digital, trusted infrastructure for aggregating European cultural heritage content. The vision is that adopting the infrastructure will result in an overall economy of scale in IT costs, flexible allocation of computing and storage resources, and improved access to shared metadata and content for both people and compatible tools.</p>\n<p>\n    The task of building the infrastructure was assigned to one of the project\'s work packages (WP2). Three major European aggregators - the Europeana Foundation, the European Library and Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center - partner with Istituto della Scienza e Tecnologie della Informazione from Pisa, Italy and the Open University, UK. Half a year into the project, the partners have released the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/results/-/document_library_display/p6BV/view/1861920/57410?_110_INSTANCE_p6BV_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-cloud%2Fresults%2F-%2Fdocument_library_display%2Fp6BV%2Fview%2F1861920\">first version of the design of the future system</a> and switched to the implementation phase. In this blog post, we\'d like to tell you about the essentials of this design, to promote further discussion on it and to encourage cooperation.</p>\n<p>\n    The conceptual diagram below features the main components of the future system. At its foundation is a set of data centres, each one set up and administered by one of the institutions. The centres are consolidated into a unified infrastructure which provides database, storage and computation resources for applications and services. At the initial stage, the underlying physical resources of various types, represented in the diagram by colour-coding, will be provided by the founding institutions in accordance with their expertise and IT constraints.</p>\n<p>\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/54b054f8-1e85-4373-abfb-aad11e95cc50\"></p>\n<p>\n    <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/b6530e50-3673-40b9-8a86-98becd71bba3\">Download a larger version of this diagram</a></p>\n<p>\n    On top of the resource infrastructure, a set of software services will be developed. The services, described in detail in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/results/-/document_library_display/p6BV/view/1861920/57410?_110_INSTANCE_p6BV_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-cloud%2Fresults%2F-%2Fdocument_library_display%2Fp6BV%2Fview%2F1861920\">design deliverable</a>, will be accessible via a set of standardised REST APIs and form a service suite providing basic functionality for aggregation and storage of metadata and content by aggregators. The aggregators will use APIs encapsulating these services to build tools supporting their specialised aggregation flows. The project will develop basic ingestion tools to showcase the potential of the platform and to encourage its adoption by the aggregators. In this vein, the Europeana Cloud infrastructure will be a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform providing aggregation services and tools, storage used by these services, and computation resources allowing them to run.</p>\n<p>\n    Faithful to the spirit of Europeana to promote open-source software, the project will use and develop open-source tools and components. The domain of cloud computing and cloud services has recently seen a huge amount of open-source development and some projects have reached the level of maturity where they can now compete with and beat commercial vendors.</p>\n<p>\n    Technology choices made by the infrastructure team to start building the system reflect the decision to be on the forefront of innovation without compromising on maturity of the solutions: Europeana Cloud will use the popular Apache Cassandra distributed database to store metadata and OpenStack, the hottest name in the cloud technology world, for its storage and computation layers. Naturally, the list of used solutions will evolve during the project\'s lifetime. The software developed by the project will be open-source as well, allowing for easy external contribution by the community and for easy standalone installations exploiting some of the features of the platform.</p>\n<p>\n    One of the main themes of cloud computing in general and of Europeana Cloud in particular is cost efficiency for users achieved through consolidation of resources and economy of scale. Institutional and project aggregators will save on IT infrastructure maintenance costs through switching to Europeana Cloud. To sustain the infrastructure beyond the project\'s lifetime, several sustainability models will be proposed by another part of the project (WP5). Apart from the option to cover the costs directly by paying, institutions will be able to contribute their IT resources to the distributed infrastructure. To ensure the required level of reliability of infrastructure components, a set of SLAs (Service Level Agreements) will be developed and imposed on new joiners.</p>\n<p>\n    Another motivation for cloud computing which is going to be explored by the project is flexibility. The idea is that there is no need for constant provision of infrastructure components to support occasional spikes of activity. Instead, these components can be provided temporarily and disposed of when not needed. This allows for flexible pay-as-you-go cost schemes and easier resource planning for organisations. Europeana Cloud will investigate the applicability of such schemes in the cultural heritage domain by maintaining a part of its infrastructure in a public cloud and adding it to the main system as a \'flexible\' component which can be extended on-demand to accommodate spikes of activity. A standard use-case envisioned to justify this need are periodical resource-intensive publication cycles which many aggregators maintain to publish new content.</p>\n<p>\n    Another important audience which will be addressed by the project are humanities and social science researchers. Despite ubiquitous digital innovation in research and a multitude of new tools being developed for humanity scholars, the usability of these tools is severely limited. Due to many factors, such as incompatible data formats, limited technical or legal accessibility to relevant content, technical hurdles of various kinds, knowledge barriers, and others, there is no free encounter yet between tools and content. The herculean task of enabling this encounter will be addressed by the Europeana Research portal, an extension of the European Library portal, which will be built on top of the Europeana Cloud infrastructure by the project (in WP3).</p>\n<p>\n    All in all, Europeana Cloud is a complex technical project with a heterogenous group of stakeholders. We are encouraged by the availability of mature cloud technologies, by overwhelming adoption of these technologies by other industries and by a shared understanding that the time has come to foster this adoption in the cultural heritage sector. It is through the joint effort of different stakeholders - data providers, aggregators, research institutions - that we can work out how cloud technologies will create a revolution in our sector as well.</p>\n<h3>\n    Get involved</h3>\n<p>\n    We welcome expressions of interest and proposals of contribution to the project from partners in the Europeana Network and outside it. The first opportunity to discuss all these will be at the Europeana Cloud Architecture Workshop, on 28 October 2013 in the Koninlijke Bibliotheek in the Hague.

Often a researcher doesn’t want to manually filter through search results to find the most relevant item so this last task was to establish if easier possibilities for filtering exist.</p>\n<p>\n    <img src=\"http://oldpro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=3da53db8-bfd6-4f60-9642-774bba0b35d4&amp;groupId=1414567&amp;t=1375262870323\"><strong>Identifying Improvements</strong><br>\n    In the second part of the workshop, participants were asked to create case studies that illustrated how a fictional researcher might use Europeana both in its current form and in a future version with new tools and services (particularly those that could be supplied through the cloud).</p>\n<p>\n    By the end of the session, participants had identified several areas in which the Europeana Cloud project could improve the usefulness of Europeana for researchers. Their suggestions included:</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Metadata Ranking: </strong>It was felt that few items in Europeana had sufficient metadata to make them truly useful for research. A ‘star-ranking system’ for metadata was suggested as a possible solution. Users of Europeana could rate an item for the quality of its metadata from 1 star (poor quality) up to 5 stars (excellent quality) and this would allow researchers to focus on the most useful objects.</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Multi-lingual Resources:</strong> At present, metadata can be submitted to Europeana in the native language of the contributing organisation and users must search in every language to be sure they have searched thoroughly for a particular term (eg. \'<em>World War One</em>’, ‘<em>La Première Guerre Mondiale</em>’ (French), ‘<em>Pierwsza Woyna Swiatowa</em>’ (Polish), etc). The Expert Forum recommended that multilingual metadata be dynamically generated by the system as it is impractical to ask content providers to provide multi-lingual search terms, and that a thesaurus or translation tool be built that can automatically link multilingual metadata.</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Results:</strong> Better browsing functionality was unanimously recommended. Suggestions included spatial mapping and temporal mapping via maps and timelines. Simple conceptual maps, such as tag clouds or other visualisations would also be desirable. </p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Development: </strong>There was overwhelming consensus that researchers from all disciplines would want to export result sets into specialised, often domain-specific tools. It was therefore strongly recommended that Europeana not develop specialised tools, but rather focus on:</p>\n<p>\n    -generalised tools to aid in discovery;<br>\n    -tools that allow for (meta)data export into a variety of formats;<br>\n    -tools that provide more sophisticated and targeted filtering of results than are currently available.</p>\n<p>\n    The workshop also resulted in a number of other learning points, all of which will feed into the work of Europeana Cloud to develop better tools and services for Europeana and the research community.

It will provide a broad review of the tools and content that can be accessed through Europeana Cloud, and develop recommendations for future work, including how the engagement of researchers will continue beyond the lifetime of the project to ensure their future use and uptake of the Europeana Research platform. </p>', '{\"file\":\"http:\\/\\/oldpro.europeana.eu\\/image\\/image_gallery?uuid=5e9d7884-e129-41ed-88bb-d331d7ccc35e&groupId=1414567&t=1375262870304\"}', ''),

The first phase of the project is intended to map what such a storage could look like. Europeana Cloud is in full flow now and has published a mission statement, a <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/europeana-cloud-factsheet-final\">factsheet</a> and a set of high-level principles to guide its development and research.</p>\n<p>\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/b179563a-a313-4a87-8e0c-cf42da37f105\"></p>\n<p>\n    <strong>The mission statement</strong>: \'Europeana Cloud serves Europe’s cultural heritage institutions by delivering a more efficient solution to the current methods of storing, sharing and providing access to cultural heritage objects. It does so by providing an open source system that stores and enables services for accessing structured metadata and content. The intention is to re-use and share this material with users and participants. Europeana Cloud will be available under a sustainable business model and be governed by its users.\'</p>\n<h3>\n    Principles</h3>\n<p>\n    The mission statement breaks down into the following eight principles:</p>\n<p>\n    Europeana Cloud primarily serves Europe’s cultural heritage institutions, enabling them to provide audiences with access to their digital objects</p>\n<p>\n    Driven by the needs of the cultural heritage industry, Europeana Cloud provides the services to enable the sharing of metadata and content for the purposes of providing access to digital objects. This delivers improved services to providers with low barriers to entry and exit.</p>\n<p>\n    Europeana Cloud promotes openness</p>\n<p>\n    Openness supports re-use and sharing of cultural heritage objects as well as providing an infrastructure with low barriers for expansion and further development. Europeana Cloud produces open source software, has a preference for open standards, open file formats and promotes open content. Closed standards and closed formats can only be viewed if there is software available that can read proprietary file formats, they may prove difficult to access on future operatings systems/devices.</p>\n<p>\n    Europeana Cloud delivers a more efficient solution to the current methods of storing, sharing and providing access to digital cultural heritage objects</p>\n<p>\n    Europeana Cloud delivers efficiencies to cultural heritage providers along the lines of: a reduction of IT costs as compared with classic hosting technologies, avoiding IT infrastructure costs, enabling more time to focus on strategy and innovation, and the pooling of resources. Efficiencies are also expected in terms of saving time, speed of delivery, better integration across the Europeana Network, offering services with high availability, reliability, and security and better interoperability, easier management and greater automation.</p>\n<p>\n    Europeana Cloud operates under a sustainable business model</p>\n<p>\n    To ensure the long term sustainability of the services provided by Europeana Cloud, the project will operate under a sustainable business model. A variety of options will be discussed in light of EU funding availability and the need to become self-sustaining. This may allow for a reduction on the reliance of competitive funding rounds, and will encourage long-term investment.</p>\n<p>\n    Europeana Cloud provides the infrastructure to access metadata and content</p>\n<p>\n    Europeana Cloud delivers storage and services to provide secure, robust, technology neutral and sustainable access to metadata and content. These services include but are not limited to programmatic read/write access to Europeana Cloud, controlling the access to Europeana Cloud, connecting to other data services and systems and version control of data in Europeana Cloud.</p>\n<p>\n    Europeana Cloud is accessible through standardised data models</p>\n<p>\n    Europeana Cloud believes interoperability is crucial for cooperation and for the use of materials in its service. Europeana Cloud makes all metadata accessible using internationally recognised standard data models. Although standards are important for re-use and interoperability, Europeana Cloud understands that source formatting is important. Europeana Cloud does not remove contributed source documents in favour of standardised models.</p>\n<p>\n    Europeana Cloud supports a legal framework to govern access and re-use</p>\n<p>\n    Europeana Cloud is linked to the Europeana Licensing Framework that enables the access to - and re-use of - metadata and content according to differing provider and user profiles. Each user and provider provides, makes available and re-uses metadata and content in different ways with, and for, different purposes. The legal framework ensures that these requirements are met.</p>\n<p>\n    Europeana Cloud is a governed and led by the community</p>\n<p>\n    Europeana Cloud serves the needs of its community: the providers, members and users of the services make use of and build on <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/network/network-documents/-/document_library_display/4jQL/view/1505814\">cultural commons principles</a>. The community is self-regulating and has responsibility for establishing the boundaries of the community as well as the services provided. These services include raising awareness, offering and enabling access to resources and tools as well as ensuring Europeana Cloud is a trusted and secure resource and service for the community.</p>\n<h3>\n    What’s next?</h3>\n<p>\n    In the following period, we will fine-tune these principles to match the needs of the sector with the way the project will develop in the coming years.</p>\n<p>\n    <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/1414567/84231383-421f-4af0-86f2-c8bf040558e1\">Download the High Level Principles document</a></p>\n<p>\n    Tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> </p>', '{\"file\":\"http:\\/\\/pro.europeana.eu\\/documents\\/89999\\/b179563a-a313-4a87-8e0c-cf42da37f105\"}', '');
